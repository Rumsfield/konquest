# Discord Messages
# 
# This config file defines the messages that will be sent to Discord channels when DiscordSRV
# is installed and integrated with Konquest.
#
# You can use PlaceholderAPI placeholders, and default placeholders in the messages.
# The default placeholders are:
#   %PLAYER% - A player's name
#   %KINGDOM% - A kingdom's name
#   %TERRITORY% - A territory's name (town, capital, sanctuary, ruin, camp)
#
# You can use emojis and stickers in your message, referenced by name.
# For example, the smile face emoji is ":smile:".
#
# You can include media like pictures or GIFs in your message, referenced by file name.
# The media file must be placed in the server's plugins/Konquest/ folder (the same folder as this file).
# For example, if there is a picture of a sword saved as file plugins/Konquest/sword.jpg, the message
# would include %MEDIA:sword.jpg% to embed the image with the Discord message.
#
# Message text that is a link to a website will embed a link in Discord to that website.
#
# Remember to use the "/k admin reload" command after modifying this file if the server is running.
# 
# /!\ DO NOT MODIFY VERSION /!\
