# Town Option Overrides
# 
# All towns and kingdom capitals have a set of options which affect how each town works.
# By default, the town lords can modify these options in-game.
# Use this config file to force any town options to a fixed value for all towns, and prevent
# players from modifying it in-game.
# 
#
# Remember to use the "/k admin reload" command after modifying this file if the server is running.
# 
# /!\ DO NOT MODIFY VERSION /!\
