# Loot Table
# Instructions: There are 3 categories of loot: items, potions and enchanted_books. Modify, add or remove entries
#    from each category. You may remove all entries from a category. The format is:
# 
#   loot:
#     name: <display name>          # The name that players see for this loot table
#     items:
#       <MATERIAL>:                 # Must be from this list: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
#         amount: <integer>         # The number of items in the stack
#         weight: <integer>         # The relative probability weight, 0 to disable
#     potions:
#       <POTION>:                   # Must be from this list: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionType.html
#         upgraded: <boolean>       # true/false, is this potion level 2?
#         extended: <boolean>       # true/false, is this potion extended in time?
#         weight: <integer>         # The relative probability weight, 0 to disable
#     enchanted_books:
#       <ENCHANTMENT>:              # Must be from this list: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html
#         level: <integer>          # The enchantment level, 0 to randomly choose any level
#         weight: <integer>         # The relative probability weight, 0 to disable
# 
# The relative probability weight is the chance that the entry is chosen as loot. This percent probability is
# calculated by the weight of the individual entry divided by the sum of all weights. For example, in this default
# table, GOLD_INGOT has a weight of 4, and the sum of all weights is 150, so the percent probability of GOLD_INGOT
# is (4/150) * 100 = 2.67%. Entries with larger weights are more likely to be chosen as loot.
#
# The total weight for the loot section's items/potions/enchanted_books is independent from the ruins section's total weight.
#
# Here are the loot table sections. Each section defines items, potions, and enchanted_books.
#   loot:             The default town monument loot.
#   loot_special:
#     <Profession>:   Town monument loot for every villager profession.
#     ...
#   loot_custom:
#     <Custom Name>:  Town monument loot for your own custom named sections.
#     ...
#   ruins:            The default ruin loot.
#   ruins_custom:
#     <Custom Name>:  Ruin loot for your own custom named sections.
