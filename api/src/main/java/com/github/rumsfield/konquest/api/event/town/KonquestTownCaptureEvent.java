 * Called before an enemy player captures a town for their own kingdom.

 * Players capture towns for their kingdoms when they destroy the final critical block in the town monument.
 * When a town is captured, it transfers ownership to the attacking player's kingdom.
 * Canceling this event will prevent the town from being captured, but the final critical block will still be broken.

 * 
 * <p>
 * After this event is cancelled, the town will remain un-captured, but all critical blocks will be broken.
 * The monument will regenerate as normal after enemy players break the most recent monument block.
