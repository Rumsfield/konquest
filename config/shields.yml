# Town Shields
# Instructions: Set up each town shield option in this file. Each option has a name, time and cost-per-resident. For example,
#   <name>:
#     time: <shield duration in seconds>
#     cost: <favor cost per town resident>
# 
# You can change existing names (Level-1, Level-2, etc), times and costs, and add more options.
# Lines that begin with "#" (like this one) are comments, and only convey information.
# Use a YAML parser to make sure this file is correctly formatted with no errors, like https://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
